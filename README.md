# Installation
* Upload the files to your webserver so that `./www/` should be exposed as the root folder. 
* Set db properties in `config.php`
* Run ```php install.php```
* Run ```php server.php``` (it's react-driven loop process)


# Updates

Eventually, there will be updates which means that database structure and some fixtures will change.  
For those purposes there is `updates` folder which contains `sql` files.  

To create new update run `php ./updates/create-new.php`. Modify created file according your needs.  

To install updates just run `php install.php`.  

**Beware!**  
Do not modify existing updates once they are under VCS. Each update is executed only once.  
If you need more changes, create a new one.
